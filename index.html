            >
            . With the right investment in the technology ecosystem, we can see
            the number increase exponentially. Technology empowers
            entrepreneurship and startups. The tech industry encourages
            individuals to pursue innovative ideas, create their own ventures,
            and contribute to economic growth. Technology has also facilitated
            remote work opportunities. With advancements in communication and
            collaboration tools, people can work remotely, eliminating
            geographical barriers and expanding employment opportunities. This
            enables Nigerians to participate in global projects, collaborate
            with globally distributed teams, and access opportunities that were
            previously limited by physical location.

            Laptops are essential tools for individuals to participate in the
            digital economy, engage in remote work, and acquire digital skills.
            By ensuring widespread access to laptops, Nigeria can bridge the
            digital divide, empower its citizens tto take advantage of tech
            opportunities, and drive economic growth in a more inclusive and
            equitable manner.
            <a href="https://nexascale.org/">Nexascale</a> recognizes the
            significant obstacle faced by aspiring individuals in starting their
            tech careers due to the lack of access to laptops. While commendable
            efforts have been made by individuals and organizations to purchase
            laptops for those in need, it remains unfeasible to provide laptops
            for everyone, leaving some without the opportunity to begin their
            tech journeys.

            NexaScale’s core mission revolves around connecting individuals with
            the opportunities necessary to initiate and advance their careers.
            However, access to laptops is essential for such progress. To
            address this challenge in Nigeria, we have partnered with some hubs,
            procuring a substantial number of laptops to be housed in these
            locations. We prioritize areas where a significant number of our
            members reside, ensuring that those who need laptops the most are
            given priority. As mentioned in our video announcement, our aim is
            to establish a Laptop Sharing Initiative within these hubs,
            providing individuals with access to the necessary tools as they
            build their careers until they can afford their own laptops.

            By extending computer access to a wider audience, we anticipate a
            transformative impact on their lives and the broader community.
            However, we cannot accomplish this mission alone. We call upon your
            support to make this initiative a success. Please help us amplify
            our cause by sharing this initiative on social media or

            >. Any contributions made to our laptop fund will directly aid in
            acquiring more laptops for those in need. Additionally, if you’re

            NexaScale understands that having a laptop plays a key role in
            getting into tech and landing one’s dream job. With a laptop, people
            are empowered to learn digital skills and build products that can
            impact the world. However, we cannot accomplish this mission alone.
            We call upon your support to make this initiative a success. Please
            help us amplify our cause by sharing this initiative on social media
            or Donate to our laptop fund.
